# Project Reflection
Overall, I was able to meet each learning goal that I set out for the course project. I will highlight each learning goal below and how I was able to meet it:

- Gain a deeper understanding of malware analysis for attribution purposes and defense purposes
    - I was able to achieve this goal by highlighting what information in particular is helpful for when attributing malware to a source vs. what is helpful for defense purposes. This information is listed in the [“So What Information is Useful?” section](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#so-what-information-is-useful) of the guide.
    - I emphasized in the guide that the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are best used for malware attribution, as they are much harder to change and will remain fairly consistent over time. On the other hand, strings, hashes, and IP addresses are suited for defense purposes as the information is much more easily available & it can be used to create YARA rules.
- Learn how to set up a sandbox environment for malware analysis
    - I was able to achieve this goal by walking the reader through how to set up an isolated REMnux environment via VirtualBox. This information is listed in the [“Setting up a Sandboxed Environment” section](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#setting-up-a-sandboxed-environment) of the guide.
    - Prior to writing this guide, I had no experience setting up a sandboxed environment. Being able to split how to set one up into six steps (installing VirtualBox, installing the REMnux .OVA file, installing relevant programs, acquiring .zip files of malware samples, isolating the VM from the host machine, and unziping the malicious files) helped me cement my knowledge in setting up a sandboxed environment.
- Learn more about YARA rules and other methods of anti-virus defense
    - I was able to learn more about YARA rules by writing and diving into multiple topics: what [YARA rules are,](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#what-are-yara-rules) [what the attributes of an effective YARA rule are](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#what-are-yara-rules), [how to create a YARA rule](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#what-are-yara-rules), and [how to run and test a YARA rule](https://caitlincoffey.com/malwareanalysis/#what-are-yara-rules). These were all topics I was unfamiliar with prior to starting this project, and writing on them helped me cement my knowledge in how to create an effective YARA rule for any malware sample. In the guide, I walk users step-by-step for how to make a YARA rule targeting a specific Industroyer malware sample from MalwareBazaar. I also wrote a simple YARA rule targeting the eicar.com testing file for anti-virus software.
    - I did not go into other methods of anti-virus defense in the guide (namely AI defenses), but from the Malwarebytes article I was able to see that Malwarebytes [has incorporated AI for attempting to detect 0-day malicious files](https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/detections/malware-ai).
