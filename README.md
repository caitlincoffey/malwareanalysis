# An Intro to Malware Analysis

Have you ever wanted to learn how to analyze malware, determine malware attribution, and learn more about how others defend against malware? Then this guide is for you!

Topics covered in this guide:
- How to set up a Sandbox environment
- How to determine malware attribution
- What are YARA rules
- How to collect useful malware information for generating YARA rules
- AI applications in defending against malware

Please note that this guide assumes readers already have some baseline knowledge in C, Linux, virtual machines, and Ghidra. If you as a reader are unfamiliar with any of these topics, I suggest you look into them before reading more about this guide. I have a tutorial for how to use Ghidra (https://sites.google.com/view/ghidra-reverse-engineering/home#h.s1qs2m8gk4s9)[here].
